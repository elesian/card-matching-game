/* ### A [Memory Matching Game](https://www.memozor.com/memory-games/for-kids/pokemon-game)

- The game starts out with a series of paired images that are hidden from the user.
- The first 2 images the user clicks on are revealed.
- If the revelaed images match they remain uncovered.
- If the images do not match, they are hidden once again.
- The user continues until they have matched all the images.

_Additional_

- Keep track of how many guesses it took the user to complete the game.
- Randomise the starting position of the images to stop people cheating.
